    subtitle: "I’m a first-year MPH candidate at UNC Gillings, specializing in global health policy and program evaluation. My current work with the Water Institute focuses on WASH in healthcare facilities, building on prior experience with handwashing programs at FHI 360, USAID-funded HIV/AIDS initiatives, and clinical systems at Carilion Clinic.

Previously, I studied at Duke Kunshan University, where I gained cross-cultural experience that continues to shape my perspective. I’m building on these early experiences to strengthen my technical skills in program evaluation and systems analysis, with the goal of contributing to effective, locally led approaches in international development and health systems."
